BDD is used in the unit tests (maybe not in all of them).

I'm not sure if BDD is the right thing to do in every unit test here so if you happen to read this 
and have an objection to using BDD in some of the tests that are written here please share with me your idea. Thanks.



Note to Jboy: while a test fixture in TDD typically focuses on the class, in BDD, the emphasis is on a 
certain "scenario"/context for the class under test.
